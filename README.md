# Official-Website-for-Colby-s-East-Asian-Band
This is the official website for East Asian Band in Colby College.
To run the code successfully, one needs to upload the file onto a server. 
Video and audio files are too large to be uploaded, 
so one should create a folder called audio including six files with names "dizi.mp3", "erhu.mp3", "guzheng.mp3", "yangqin.mp3", "ruan.mp3", "pipa.mp3" and
a folder called video inclusing four files with names "video.mov", "video.mp4", "video2.mp4", "video3.mp4".
However, it is OK to not inlcude those aforementioned files, audios and videos will not be playable, but other features of the website can work.
